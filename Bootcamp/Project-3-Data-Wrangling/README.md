# Project 3: Data Wrangling

This project focuses on data wrangling techniques using Python and pandas. The goal was to clean, structure, and prepare raw data for analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Tasks Completed
- Loaded and explored a messy dataset (CSV format)
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Standardized formats (e.g. dates, strings)
- Reorganized the DataFrame for easier analysis

## 🎯 Objective
To practice real-world data cleaning skills and transform raw data into a usable format for analysis or modeling.

## 📝 Notes
The original dataset is not included due to size or access limitations. However, the full cleaning process is documented in the notebook.
