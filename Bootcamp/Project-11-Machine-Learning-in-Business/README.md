# Oil Well Profitability Prediction – Sprint 11 Project

This project was developed as part of a data science Bootcamp program. The goal is to help **OilyGiant**, an oil company, identify the most profitable region to drill 200 new oil wells.

## 📊 Project Summary

- Analyzed geological data from **three regions**
- Built **linear regression models** to predict oil reserves
- Selected the top **200 wells** with the highest predicted reserves per region
- Calculated potential **profits** based on reserve estimates and business constraints
- Applied **bootstrapping (1000 iterations)** to estimate risk and confidence intervals
- Recommended the region with **highest average profit** and **risk < 2.5%**

## 💼 Business Constraints

- Budget: **$100 million** for 200 wells
- Revenue: **$4.5 per barrel**, with reserves in **thousands of barrels**
- Loss risk must be below **2.5%**

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Linear regression modeling
- Performance metrics: **RMSE**, mean predicted volume
- Profit and risk analysis with **bootstrapping**
- Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## ✅ Conclusion

The project provided a data-driven recommendation to select the most profitable and least risky region for investment.
